# Web programming Project

This is a project work for a web programming -course of my studies. It's a chat application related to for example Tinder. The frontend is built with React, and the backend is developed using Node.js with the Express framework.

I have a repository for this courses' exercises, which can be found via this [link](https://github.com/JanniT/Web_Programming_Course)

## Prerequisites

- mongodb server v.7.0.2 on port ```mongodb://localhost:27017```

## Installation

- Open 2x terminals (git bash)
- Navigate on the first to /client and on the second to /server
- run ```npm run install``` to download dependencies

## How to run the app
Run ```$ npm start``` in the server folder, to run the backend. This should connect to port ```http://localhost:5000/```

Run ```$ npm start``` in the client folder, to run the front-end. This should connect to port ```http://localhost:3000/```

Open the http://localhost:3000/[http://localhost:3000/] in your web browser to access the application
