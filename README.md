# Web programming Project

This is a project work for a web programming -course of my studies. It's a chat application related to for example Tinder. The frontend is built with React, and the backend is developed using Node.js with the Express framework.

I have a repository for this courses' exercises, which can be found via this [link](https://github.com/JanniT/Web_Programming_Course)

## Prerequisites
- node.js and npm
- mongodb ```(mongodb://localhost:27017)```

This app has been made with Node v18.18.2

## How to run the app
Run ```$ npm start``` in the server folder, to run the backend. This should connect to port ```http://localhost:5000/```

Run ```$ npm start``` in the client folder, to run the front-end. This should connect to port ```http://localhost:3000/``` (and open this in the browser)
